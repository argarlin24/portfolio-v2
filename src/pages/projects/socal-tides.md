SoCal Tides uses data from the NOAA CO-OPS API to display daily and monthly tide data for three Southern California regions. The motivation for this website stemmed from the lack of easy to access and free/ad-free tide information.

This site was built using JAM (JavaScript, APIs, Markup) Stack architecture. The tech used are React, and Gatsby for front end structure, Styled Components for styling, the CO-OPS API for tide data, IndexDB/Dexie.js for caching data.
